Thank-you for purchasing Easy Save 2, and supporting the Unity scene.

##### PlayMaker Users #####

To enable the Playmaker Action, go to ‘Assets/Easy Save 2’ and press ‘Enable or Update PlayMaker Action’.

##### Important Note to Android Users ##### 

Your application may need the correct permissions set to be able to save to device. 
To set these, go to: 

Edit -> Project Settings -> Player -> Android Tab -> Other Settings -> Configuration -> External (SDCard)

##### Important Note to iOS and Android Users ##### 

If using 'Strip ByteCode', you must place the 'link.xml' file supplied with Easy Save into your Assets folder (this is done automatically from v2.60 onwards).
'Use micro mscorlib' does not work with Easy Save as mscorlib has no File I/O functionality.

##### Important Note to those using Encryption in iOS #####

If using encryption it may be necessary to declare that you are using encryption in certain countries.
For example, you will be asked if you are using encryption when submitting an app to the Apple App Store.

If you are not using encryption, and you do not wish to declare this, you should replace the blank MoodkieSecurity.dll file
supplied with Easy Save 2 with the MoodkieSecurity.dll found at http://www.moodkie.com/easysavedownloads/MoodkieSecurity.dll.
